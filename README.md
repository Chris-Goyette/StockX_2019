# Stock-X Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of my data analysis skills, encompassing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving insightful conclusions. The focus of the project is on the sneaker sales market, analyzing factors that influence the sale prices of different brands, especially 'Yeezy' and 'Off-White'.

## Data
The data for this project can be found on the [Stock-X link here](https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/)

## Objectives
- To clean and prepare the sales data for analysis.
- To perform EDA to understand the distributions and relationships within the data.
- To use visualizations to uncover insights about the sales trends and price factors.
- To demonstrate proficiency in using Python and various data analysis libraries.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.8
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
  - Seaborn: For high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Project Structure
The analysis is conducted within a single Jupyter Notebook, which is organized into distinct sections for clarity and ease of understanding:

- **Data Cleaning**: The initial part of the notebook is dedicated to preparing the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this section, I perform an in-depth exploration of the dataset. I use descriptive statistics to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of the data, and I visualize the data distributions through histograms and box plots.

- **Visualizing Data Relationships**: Here, I dive into the relationships between different variables using scatter plots. I leverage the `hue` parameter to add a categorical dimension to the visualizations, which helps in understanding how different brands compare against each other.

- **Correlation Analysis**: I calculate and visualize the correlation matrix to understand the linear relationships between variables, utilizing heatmaps to make the data interpretation intuitive.

- **Insights**: The notebook concludes with a summary of the insights derived from the analysis, highlighting interesting patterns and trends observed in the sneaker sales data.

- `StockX_2019.ipynb`: The all-in-one Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations.

- `README.md`: This document, providing an overview and instructions for navigating the project.

## Data Cleaning Highlights
- Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Stripped unnecessary whitespace from string columns.
- Normalized data formats for consistency.

## EDA Highlights
- Used histograms and box plots for distribution analysis.
- Created violin plots to compare distributions between brands.
- Analyzed correlations and visualized them using heatmaps.
- Explored relationships with scatter plots, enhancing them with `hue` and `alpha` parameters for better interpretability.

## Insights Gained
- Identified the price distribution and range for different shoe brands.
- Explored the relationship between shoe size and sale price.
- Analyzed how different variables correlate with one another.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 and above installed.
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in order to see the analysis process from start to finish.

## Future Work
- Integrate more advanced statistical analysis to test hypotheses.
- Implement machine learning models to predict future sales trends.
- Expand the dataset to include more brands and temporal data for time series analysis.
